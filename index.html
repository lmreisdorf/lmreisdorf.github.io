  <h1>Lynette Reisdorf</h1>
  <h2>Software Development Student at Western Governors University</h2>
  <p>I am currently pursuing a second bachelor's degree after earning a BA in History from UC Davis in 2003, an MA in History from CSU Stanislaus in 2009 and teaching 
  high school for nearly 20 years. I live in Northern California with my husband and 2 daughters (12 & 8). I am interested in gaining knowledge and experience leading 
  to a career in mobile android development, frontend development or full-stack development. I am excited to learn new things and gain experience that will lead me to 
  a new career!</p>
